# Project-Toki


## Introduction

I'm a fan of a silly little language called Toki Pona, so I created some useful (or not) tools to analyse and process this language.

To learn more about the language check:

## Setup

```shell
git clone https://github.com/BaronVladziu/Project-Toki.git
cd Project-Toki
./setup.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```
